  - Flex Containers 
  - Custom Properties

  - DOM Manipulation
    - Event Listeners to update user input onto the display

### What I learned

- can update string to float using parseFloat()

### Continued development

I have a lot of different 'if else' functions in my event listener, I would like to come back and make this cleaner once I learn of a good strategy to do so
